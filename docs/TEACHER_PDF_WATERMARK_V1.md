# Teacher PDF Watermark v1 - FRONTEND

Generated: 2026-06-07 18:44:56

## Implemented
- PDF Premium downloads now attempt to create a watermarked private copy before sending.
- Watermark includes teacher name, masked email, download code, date, and Alemancenter Teacher Pro.
- Non-PDF files remain protected by subscription checks and download logs.
- Download log now stores:
  - watermark_applied
  - watermark_text
  - watermarked_path
- Admin download logs show whether watermark was applied.

## Technical note
This v1 uses a pure-Go incremental PDF annotation watermark to avoid introducing external dependencies.
For very complex/encrypted PDFs, the download falls back to the original protected file instead of blocking the teacher.
